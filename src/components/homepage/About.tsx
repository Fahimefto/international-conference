              The International Conference on Advanced Research in Computer,
              Electrical, and Software Engineering (ARCES) is a prestigious
              platform for research in computer, software, and electrical
              engineering. The key aspect of ARCES is its encouragement of the
              necessary interaction between scientists, researchers, engineers,
              corporate executives, and academic students to bridge the gap
              between government, business, and academia. To develop this
              motivation, eminent scholars in pertinent domains provide keynote
              addresses, tutorials, workshops, exhibitions, and oral
              presentations. Academic researchers will disclose the results and
              findings of laboratory-based investigations at this conference. To
              inform academia about recent developments and useful findings,
              industry professionals illustrate cutting-edge research in 4IR
              technologies. For discussions of recent developments in
              contemporary computing intelligence, the ARCES platform will also
              address regional and global concerns.
